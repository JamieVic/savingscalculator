# Savings Calculator
## About the Project
The savings calculator can determine how much your savings balance will be at based on the annual interest rate and how many years.
## How to Use
This program works using any Python interpreter. To calculate a balance, you need to enter a balance, the interest rate and the number of years. After those figures are entered, a final balance is printed.
## How it Works
Three input variables take the amount, interest rate and number of years. These variables are written within a try/except statement to print an error if the entries aren't floating numbers. The result is initially created in the rawResult variable which is then used in the result variable to only print up to two decimal places.
